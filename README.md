# Nimbo First Project : Github Data Analysis

This Project Uses MongoDB to Store Data and Information.
All Raw Data is Also Being Stored!

One Mechanism to Get Data Analysis is That While Running we Store Processed Data in 3 Different Intervals:
10 minutes
1 hour
1 day

If You Were Eager to Get Data Analysis for a Specific Time Interval, it is Also Possible!
Just Pass your Dates as:

"yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"
